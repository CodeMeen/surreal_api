# Surreal Wallet Backend

Welcome to the Ethereum Wallet Backend project! This backend application is built with Node.js and utilizes ethers.js, Web3.js, and Moralis to interact with the Ethereum blockchain and provide wallet functionalities.

## Overview

The Ethereum Wallet Backend provides a set of APIs for managing Ethereum wallets, including creating new wallets, transferring Ether (ETH), querying wallet balances, and interacting with smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It aims to be a reliable and secure backend solution for Ethereum wallet management.

## Features

- **Wallet Creation:** Generate new Ethereum wallets securely.
- **ETH Transfer:** Send Ether (ETH) from one wallet to another.
- **Balance Inquiry:** Check the balance of a specific Ethereum wallet.
- **Smart Contract Interaction:** Interact with smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Security:** Securely handle private keys and sensitive user data.
- **Scalability:** Designed to handle a high volume of requests efficiently.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime environment for running server-side code.
- **Express.js:** Web application framework for Node.js to handle HTTP requests.
- **ethers.js:** JavaScript library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Web3.js:** Ethereum JavaScript API for interaction with Ethereum nodes.
- **Moralis:** Blockchain development platform providing tools for Ethereum development and integration.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your local machine.
- Ethereum node or a service provider (e.g., Infura) for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
- Moralis account for accessing their services and APIs.
