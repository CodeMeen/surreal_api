            WILL WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL DATA WITH THIRD PARTIES?
          </div>
          <div class="dctext">
            Information about our users is an important part of our business and
            we are not in the business of selling our users’ personal
            information to others. We may transfer personal data to our service
            providers or third parties in connection with Surreal Wallet’s
            operation of its business, as certain features on Surreal Wallet rely
            on various third-party products and services (collectively “Third
            Party Services”), . <br /><br />These third party services providers
            only have access to certain Personal Information, such as your
            public Wallet addresses, to perform their functions and may not use
            it for other purposes. Furthermore, they must process the personal
            information in accordance with our contractual agreements and only
            as permitted by applicable data protections laws. Business
            transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or
            buy other businesses or services. <br /><br />In such transactions,
            user information generally is one of the transferred business assets
            but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy
            notice (unless, of course, the user consents otherwise). Also, in
            the unlikely event that surrealwallet or substantially all of its
            assets are acquired, users' information will be one of the
            transferred assets.<br /><br />
            We may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and
            with our partners- like publishers, advertisers, developers, or
            right holders.

        <div class="each_terms">
          <div class="dctitle">HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE GATHER</div>
          <div class="dctext">
            We primarily use the limited information that we collect to enhance
            Surreal Wallet. Except if we sell all or a portion of our business, or
            as otherwise described below, we do not rent, trade, or sell your
            Personal Information. <br /><br />Some ways we may use your Personal
            Information are to: Contact you when necessary; Respond to your
            comments, questions, or issues related to bugs or errors with Trust
            Wallet; Provide you with additional information; Send you
            information and marketing materials about services and products
            available through Surreal Wallet, using push notifications or other
            means; Train our team members; Other internal business purposes.<br /><br />
            Aggregated Personal Data and Non-Personal Information We may share
            or disclose aggregated Personal Data or Non-Personal Information
            with service providers or with other persons we conduct business
            with, including but not limited potential third-parties for the
            purpose of showcasing the performance of the company.<br /><br />
            These service providers and other persons may also share with us
            aggregated Non-Personal Information that they have independently
            developed or acquired. Additionally, we may combine aggregate
            information from the pixel tags, and web beacons, with similar data
            we collect from other visitors to help us improve our Services.<br /><br />
            When doing so, we do our best to ensure that aggregated information
            cannot be linked back to you. Agents or Third Party Partners We may
            provide your Personal Information to our employees, contractors,
            agents, service providers, and designees (“Agents”) to enable them
            to perform certain services for us, including improvement of
            website-related services and features, and performance of
            maintenance services. Business Transfers We may choose to buy or
            sell assets.<br /><br />
            In these types of transactions, customer information is typically
            one of the business assets that would be transferred. Also, if we
            (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter
            bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, your
            Personal Information could be one of the assets transferred to or
            acquired by a third party. <br /><br />By accepting this Privacy
            Notice, as outlined above, you consent to any such transfer.
            Protection of Us and Others We will share personal information
            outside of Surreal Wallet if we have a reasonable belief that access,
            use, preservation, or disclosure of the information is reasonably
            necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal
            process, or enforceable governmental request; to cooperate with law
            enforcement;<br /><br />
            to enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or to
            protect the rights, property, or safety of Surreal Wallet, our
            employees, our users, or others.

            you also have the right not to be discriminated against because of
            the exercise of your rights. Please note that we do not sell your
            personal data.
