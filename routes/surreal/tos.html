            <br /><br />

            1.generate wallet addresses and associated private keys that you may
            use to send and receive digital assets;
            <br /><br />
            2.browse and access third party decentralized application(s)

            wallet can be stored on eligible devices. The private key is
            associated with the wallet address and, together, they can be used

            of your private key and any mnemonic phrase (“Secret Phrase”)
            associated with your wallet.<br /><br />
            You must keep your wallet address, Secret Phrase, and private key
            access information secure. It is very important that you backup your
            private keys, backup phrases or passwords. Failure to do so may
            result in the loss of control of Digital Assets associated with your
            wallet. You acknowledge and agree that we do not receive or store
            your wallet password, encrypted private key, unencrypted private
            key, or Secret Phrase associated with your wallet. We cannot

            original password. If you have not safely stored a backup of any
            wallet address and private key pairs maintained in your wallet, you
            accept and acknowledge that any Digital Assets you have associated
            with such wallet address will become inaccessible.
            <br /><br />Accordingly, we shall have no responsibility or
            liability whatsoever in the event you are unable to access your
            wallet for any reason including without limitation your failure to
            keep your wallet address, Secret Phrase and private key information
